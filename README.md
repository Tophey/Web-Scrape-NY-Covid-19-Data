# Web-Scrape-NY-Covid-19-Data
This project is what I created for the Covid-19 Data Project hosted by BroadStreet Health LLC 
when I worked there as an intern. 
It scrapes and processes the Covid-19 data in New York State from 
https://www.governor.ny.gov/keywords/coronavirus
The scraped COVID-19 data ranges from Mar. 20, 2020 to July 9, 2021, and covers all the counties in New York State.
